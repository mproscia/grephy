# grephy
CMPT 440 - Formal Languages &amp; Computability Final Project

---------------------------------------

Created file structure to use TypeScript, but still working on actual implementation. I may stick to strictly JavaScript, but also have been successful with TypeScript in other projects so I'd like to try it. If I use TypeScript, I will compile it to JavaScript.
The project can be run from the index.html file.

Still have to verify that i'll be using Javascript or if I'll be switching to Java.

---------------------------------------
TODO:
- Better understand grep utility
- work on accepting and denying input files based on alphabet
- add functionality to input function
- restructure UI a little to make it more versatile for grephy functionality
